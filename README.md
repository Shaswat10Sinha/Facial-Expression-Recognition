# Facial-Expression-Recognition
The use for emotion recognition has been on the rise on the last few years, from social media and video games to the research on customer’s experience. 
This fact has created an interest on the community for its research and development. . Because most models have used relatively limited data sets, the generalizability of these various methods remains unknown. 
We describe the problem space for facial expression analysis, which includes level of description, transitions among expression, reliability and validity of training and test data, individual differences in subjects and relation to non-verbal behavior.
The system is based on facial features extraction using the knowledge of the face geometry
